description: Inspect git changes, draft a Conventional Commit message, and create the commit when explicitly asked. Use when the user says commit, asks for a commit message, wants to stage and commit, asks to review a diff before committing, or types phrases like "commit this", "write a commit message", "prepare a commit".

# Commit

Prepare a Conventional Commit message for the current working tree, then create the commit only when the user explicitly asks for it.

## Default workflow

**Branch first:** if the user supplied a draft message, you're *editing* it (preserve their voice and intent; only fix Conventional-Commit shape and obvious issues). If they didn't, draft from scratch.

1. Read state: `git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached`, `git log -n 5 --oneline`.
2. If nothing is staged but the worktree is dirty, stage with `git add -A` and re-check `git diff --cached`. If the tree is clean, say so and stop.
3. Pick the smallest coherent scope. If the diff spans unrelated areas (app + infra, src + generated output, multiple features), call it out and propose splitting before committing.
4. Draft the message focused on *intent and impact*, not file enumeration.
5. Surface anything to review before committing — secrets, unrelated files, lock-file noise, large binary additions, generated output.

## Message format

`git log -n 5 --oneline` is the spec, not Conventional Commits canon. Match the existing tone — many repos drop scope, some require a ticket prefix (`TASK-123:`), some use sentence-case bodies, some prefix with package names instead of types. Deviate from CC when the log does.

- Body only when it clarifies *why* or flags a tradeoff. Skip it otherwise.
- Add a ticket prefix (e.g. `TASK-123`) only if the repo's history already does.

## Modes

**Draft only** (default — assume this unless the user says "commit"):

> Suggested commit message:
> ```
> type(scope): short summary
>
> optional body
> ```
> Then list anything to exclude or verify.

**Create the commit** (only when the user explicitly says commit / "commit it" / "go ahead"):

1. Stage the intended files (be specific — prefer `git add <paths>` over `git add -A` when only some files belong).
2. `git commit -m "<message>"` using a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
3. Run `git status` to confirm the tree is clean.
4. Report the resulting commit hash and subject.

## Hard rules

- **Never** add a `Co-Authored-By: Codex …` trailer or any "made with" attribution. The user's global rule forbids it.
- **Never** commit unless the user explicitly asked. Drafting is the default.
- **Never** include `.env`, credentials, tokens, or other likely secrets. If the user insists, warn first.
- **Never** `--amend` a commit you didn't author yourself (check `git log -1 --format='%an'` first). Amending another author's commit silently rewrites their work.
- **Never** rewrite history (`--amend`, `rebase`, `reset --hard`) unless explicitly requested. If a hook fails, fix the cause and create a new commit.
- **Never** blindly re-run `git commit` after a hook rewrites files. Re-run `git diff --cached` first — verify the now-staged tree is what you intended before retrying.
- **Never** revert unrelated changes in the worktree — commit only the intended files and leave the rest alone.
- **Never** push. `git push` is a separate, explicit request.
- **Never** use `-i` flags (interactive rebase/add); they break in this environment.
- **Never** skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or signing flags unless the user explicitly asks.

## Common scenarios

- **Pre-commit hook reformats files mid-commit.** The commit aborts with a dirty tree. Re-stage the now-formatted files and run `git commit` again — do *not* `--amend` (the previous commit isn't yours) and do *not* `--no-verify`.
- **Pre-commit fails on staged files but the user wants to commit a subset.** Use `git add -p` to split hunks; commit the clean subset first, leave the failing changes unstaged for the user to address.
- **Merge / cherry-pick / rebase in progress.** `git status` shows files in *both modified* or `.git/MERGE_HEAD` exists. Finish the resolution first (`git add` each resolved file, run the build/typecheck if cheap), then commit. Never `--allow-empty` past a conflict, never reset to "make it go away" — that destroys the resolution.
- **Amend or squash workflow.** Only when the user explicitly asks. For HEAD use `git commit --amend`; for older commits use `git commit --fixup=<sha>` then `git rebase -i --autosquash <base>`. Refuse if the target commit has already been pushed to a shared branch — surface the risk and let the user decide.
- **Monorepo with per-package lint/format.** Check `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, or `turbo.json` first to find the affected package, then run scripts from that package's directory — running root-level scripts often misses or duplicates work.
- **User provided a draft message.** Edit, don't replace. Preserve their voice, phrasing, and emphasis. Fix only the Conventional-Commit shape (type, scope, casing) and obvious issues (typos, wrong type). If their message is already fine, say so and use it verbatim.

## Repo-specific checks

Before committing, glance at the repo for lint/format/typecheck scripts (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, CI config). If a fast check exists and the diff plausibly affects it, run it. Don't run slow full builds or test suites unless asked.
